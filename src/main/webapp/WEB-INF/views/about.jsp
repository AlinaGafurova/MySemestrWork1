            <p>Robotics is gaining momentum all over the country. In many cities it is introduced into the school curriculum. Unfortunately, the school can not enter school, when the teacher works with the child not only on instructions, but can creatively develop the technical thinking of children. In addition, because of the large number of classes in schools, there is often a lack of equipment kits for each student, and it is very difficult to convey information to all children, taking into account the specifics of the subject. What is "Robotics"? This is not just the creation of robots. In order to light even a small robot, children must first master such skills as "modeling" and "construction".</p>
            <p>In the process of assembling different models of robots, children become acquainted with such difficult concepts as "energy", "motor", "traction", etc. In the future, this knowledge will greatly help them in the study of mathematics, physics, and informatics. By the way, not only boys and girls are successfully engaged in robotics. By developing technical thinking now, in the future they will be able to easily understand the principles of the operation of various technical devices that fill our daily lives.In the process of assembling different models of robots, children become acquainted with such difficult concepts as "energy", "motor", "traction", etc. In the future, this knowledge will greatly help them in the study of mathematics, physics, and informatics.
